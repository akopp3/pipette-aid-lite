PipetteAidLite<br />
By: Abhinav Koppu<br />

PipetteAidLite is based off the original PipetteAid program. It serves as a lighter and portable version, and incorporates new features such as Inventory tracking and a Smart Assistant. 

Once the app is downloaded, the main page will open up with two options. For now, the "Use Existing Protocol" is the only working option. This will pull a list of protocols from a database, and display it to the user. After selecting a protocol, the lab part of the app opens. The user is presented with the option to begin the protocol, or if they swipe right, they can have a quick glance at the current lab inventory. Once the protocol starts, the user can iterate through each lab task, with clear instructions on the screen, with names and location of reagents and containers. After each step, the inventory automatically updates based on the task listed on the protocol. On the bottom right corner of the screen is a microphone button, and that is where the smart assistant lives. Right now, the assitant can understand 2 questions, "Where is ___?" and "What is in ___?". It can tell you the location of any item on the lab bench, and also list what is in a specific container. This reduces the burden on the scientist to remember exactly where everything is or what is in each container if they seem to forget by accident.
